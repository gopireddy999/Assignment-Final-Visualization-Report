The report determines the connection between climate elements and crop output policy by using a general dataset. Plots and numerical analyses show relationships between the variables, confirming that the impacts of climate change on the human population are due to the addition of climate variability factors regardless of the change in climate regime. It is ascertained by the data that the necessity is to develop an adaptive response to climate risks and food production sustainability in the light of environmental dynamic circumstances.

The table shows the crop harvest for multiple crop kinds over various years of the period from 1990 to 2013. Each row as individual crop type, each column stands for a single year Returns of yields are given in hectares. The values in the table represent the agricultural production quantities separately by each crop type and each respective year.
Climate data and crop yields study acknowledges the fact that their relationship between ecological factors, and agricultural productivity is extremely complex. However, understanding these relationships is of prime importance for the devising of climate-smart strategic planning to minimize the effect of climate change on agricultural productivity and to optimize productive techniques as well.
